  <h2>OSX</h2><br>

  <ul>
   <li>
     <p>
        <font color="red">Issue:</font> On DRM-free OSX version, says "Application is damaged and must move to trash."
     </p>
     <p>
        <font color="lime">Resolve:</font> Go to System Preferences --> Security. Allow files from anywhere. Game will work now. (Or you can just use Steam...)<br><br>
     </p>
   </li>
   <li>
     <p>
        <font color="red">Issue:</font> Controller doesn't work on OSX.<br>
     </p>
     <p>
        <font color="lime">Resolve:</font> None. Gamemaker disabled controller support for OSX. <br><br><br>
     </p>
   </li>

  <h2>WINDOWS</h2><br>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
          <font color="red">Issue:</font> It says the game failed to launch and the game does not start. Then it says it could not initialize D9 D3D surfaces or something.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
          <font color="lime">Resolve:</font> Maybe not enough graphics resources avaialable.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Try:<br>
          1. Closing everything else.<br>
          2. Shrinking resolution.<br>
          3. Make sure all video card drivers are up to date and you have the latest version of DirectX.<br><br>

      <p>
          <font color="red">Issue:</font> I have a European keyboard and Z,X, and C are in inconvenient locations.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
          <font color="lime">Resolve:</font> You can also use ENTER for Z , SHIFT for X, and CTRL for C. This way you can play the game one-handed. Or you can just use a joypad.<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
          <font color="red">Issue:</font> Doing an action, game crashes with an error message // OR // Some other strange bug that does not crash the game but is clearly unintended // OR // Game consistently crashes/freezes at a certain point<br>
